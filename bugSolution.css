The corrected CSS rule uses `box-sizing: border-box;` to ensure padding and borders are included within the element's specified width:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}

.item {
  width: 50%;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

This ensures that the 50% width calculation includes padding and border, preventing unexpected overflow.  Consider adding `min-width` and `max-width` for better control of item sizes when content varies significantly.
