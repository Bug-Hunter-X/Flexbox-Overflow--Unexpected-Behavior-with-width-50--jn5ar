The following CSS rule is causing unexpected behavior:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}

.item {
  width: 50%;
}
```

This rule intends to place two `.item` elements side-by-side, evenly spaced. However, if the content within an `.item` element is too large, it can cause the flexbox to overflow or collapse unexpectedly.  The issue is that `width: 50%` doesn't account for padding, margins, and borders added to `.item`.  These add to the element's total width, exceeding 50% and causing the problem.
